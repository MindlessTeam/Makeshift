# MAKESHIFT

Makeshift is an adventure into the world of 3d-graphics (the 23rd adventure to be precise). I want to bring the engine to a point where I can use it to produce a teenie tiny game.

## Architecture

## NOTE

Because Makeshift is a project intended for learning and I am in no way an expert (or in any other way experienced) with C++ and/or Computer Science, its code is most likely quite inefficient and doesn't sport the best design decisions. I do not recommend that this engine be used in any serious production, even when it's finished.

## LICENSING
