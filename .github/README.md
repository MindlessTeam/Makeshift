# MAKESHIFT

Makeshift is an adventure into the world of 3d-graphics (the 23rd adventure to be precise) with the goal to create a functional 3d game engine with an Editor. I want to bring the engine to a point where I can use it to produce a teenie tiny game.

## Architecture
*(Basic)*

*(Game "Loop")*

## NOTE

Because Makeshift is a project intended for learning and I am in no way an expert (or *experienced*) with C++ and/or Computer Science, its code is most likely quite inefficient and doesn't sport the best design decisions. I do not recommend that this engine be used in any serious production, even when it's finished.
